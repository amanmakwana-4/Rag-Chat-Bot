    "text": "WHAT IS TYPE 2 DIABETES\n\nType 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). In this condition, the body either resists the effects of insulin (a hormone that regulates sugar movement into cells) or does not produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Glucose is an essential source of energy for cells, and its regulation is crucial for overall health. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and can develop at any age, though it is more common in adults. The condition develops gradually and can be influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors.",

Hypertension is often called the \"silent killer\" because many people have it without experiencing noticeable symptoms.
