GENERAL WELLNESS PRINCIPLES

Wellness encompasses physical mental and social well-being beyond merely the absence of illness. A holistic approach to health considers multiple interconnected factors including nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, and social connections. Individual wellness needs vary based on age, health status, and personal circumstances. Healthcare providers can offer personalized guidance based on individual situations.
