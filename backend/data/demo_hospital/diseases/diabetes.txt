WHAT IS TYPE 2 DIABETES

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). In this condition, the body either resists the effects of insulin (a hormone that regulates sugar movement into cells) or does not produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Glucose is an essential source of energy for cells, and its regulation is crucial for overall health. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and can develop at any age, though it is more common in adults. The condition develops gradually and can be influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors.

TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS

Multiple factors may increase the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. These include excess body weight particularly around the abdomen, physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle, family history of diabetes in parents or siblings, age over 45 years (though increasingly seen in younger individuals), history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, and certain ethnic backgrounds including African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American populations. Prediabetes, a condition of elevated blood sugar not yet at diabetic levels, is also a significant risk factor.

TYPE 2 DIABETES AND DAILY LIFE

Living with type 2 diabetes involves ongoing attention to daily habits and regular communication with healthcare providers. Blood sugar levels can be influenced by food choices, physical activity, stress, illness, and other factors. Understanding these connections helps individuals make informed decisions. Support from healthcare teams, diabetes educators, family members, and community resources can be valuable. Advances in understanding and management continue to improve quality of life for those with this condition.
