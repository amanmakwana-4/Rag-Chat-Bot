WHAT IS HYPERTENSION

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. Blood pressure is measured using two numbers: systolic pressure (when the heart beats) and diastolic pressure (when the heart rests between beats). Hypertension is often called the "silent killer" because many people have it without experiencing noticeable symptoms. Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early detection and management. The condition affects the cardiovascular system and can impact multiple organs over time if not properly managed.

HYPERTENSION RISK FACTORS

Several factors may increase the risk of developing hypertension. Non-modifiable risk factors include family history of high blood pressure, advancing age (risk increases after age 45 for men and 65 for women), and genetic predisposition. Modifiable risk factors include excess body weight or obesity, physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle, high sodium (salt) intake in diet, excessive alcohol consumption, chronic stress, and tobacco use including smoking. Certain underlying conditions may also contribute to elevated blood pressure readings.

HYPERTENSION SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Many individuals with hypertension experience no obvious symptoms, which is why regular screening is important. When symptoms do occur, they may include persistent headaches particularly in the morning, shortness of breath during normal activities, nosebleeds more frequent than usual, dizziness or lightheadedness, chest discomfort, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, and fatigue. Severe hypertension may cause more pronounced symptoms requiring immediate medical attention.

HYPERTENSION LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS

Managing blood pressure often involves lifestyle modifications. These include maintaining a healthy weight appropriate for your body type, engaging in regular physical activity as recommended by your healthcare provider, following a balanced diet rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains while limiting sodium intake, reducing alcohol consumption, managing stress through relaxation techniques and adequate rest, avoiding tobacco products, and maintaining regular sleep patterns. These lifestyle changes may help support overall cardiovascular health.

WHEN TO CONSULT HEALTHCARE PROVIDER ABOUT HYPERTENSION

You should consult a healthcare provider about hypertension if you have readings consistently above normal range, experience any symptoms mentioned above, have a family history of high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease, are pregnant and have elevated blood pressure readings, experience sudden severe headaches or vision changes, have chest pain or difficulty breathing, or want guidance on lifestyle modifications. Regular check-ups are recommended for monitoring and early intervention.

HYPERTENSION AND OVERALL HEALTH

Hypertension management is an important component of overall cardiovascular health. Working closely with healthcare providers helps individuals understand their specific situation and develop appropriate management strategies. Blood pressure can fluctuate based on many factors including time of day, stress levels, physical activity, and dietary intake. Consistent monitoring and communication with healthcare providers supports informed health decisions.
